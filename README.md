# twitter-clone
The goal of this project was to implement a clone of Twitter and a client that can test or simulate this server or Twitter clone in Erlang.
In this project we have built a server/engine that in the future will be connected with the Cowboy framework so it can provide complete performance of the now existing twitter.
